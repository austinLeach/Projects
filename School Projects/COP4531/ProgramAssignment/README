All sorts are in C++11.
I used linprog in order to compile and test the programs with g++ -std=c++11.
In order to run the code there is a makefile which will create the following executables.
	bucketSort
	countingSort
	heapSort
	insertionSort
	mergeSort
	quickSort
	radixSort
Each executable produces its own output file with the name of the executable + Values.
	bucketSortValues
	countingSortValues
	heapSortValues
	insertionSortValues
	mergeSortValues
	quickSortValues
	radixSortValues
These are comma delimited list of the runtimes produced by the sorts.
The output files are used for the graphing.py program in order to create the graphs.
Running graphing.py will ask for a file name input and then output a graph for that file.
